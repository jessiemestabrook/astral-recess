This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />
Additionally this project uses:
 - [easy-peasy](https://easy-peasy.now.sh/)
 - [emotion](https://emotion.sh)


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

###  `gh-pages deploy`

Deploys the app to [https://astral-recess.patrickme.dev](https://astral-recess.patrickme.dev).<br />
NB: Until I fix this, after each deploy you must edit the URL setting in the github repo settings
to properly point to `astral-recess.patrickme.dev`.  It `gh-pages` clobbers this setting every time we deploy for some reason.
